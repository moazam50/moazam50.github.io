    <h3><span class="highlight">Custom Discord Bot</span></h3>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, discord.py, Discord API</p>
    <p>Developed a Discord bot with automatic replies, custom commands, and user interaction capabilities. Successfully demonstrated integration of Python with the Discord API for communication automation. Used a Discord token and the Discord library in Python to handle bot authentication and interactions.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight">Snort vs. Suricata IDS Comparison</span></h3>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Snort, Suricata, Traffic Generators, Wireshark, Virtual Machines</p>
    <p>This project involved a detailed comparison between Snort and Suricata to evaluate their performance, detection capabilities, and resource usage under different attack scenarios. The goal was to determine which IDS performs better in real-world network environments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Detection Accuracy:</strong> Both systems detected known attacks effectively, with Suricata excelling in complex environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Suricata showed better scalability and handled high-speed traffic more effectively than Snort.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Snort was easier to configure for basic setups, while Suricata required more advanced configuration for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>False Positives/Negatives:</strong> Suricata had fewer false negatives, making it more reliable for complex attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Suricata demonstrated superior scalability, especially in large, high-traffic networks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Suricata is better suited for large-scale, high-traffic environments, while Snort is effective for smaller, less complex networks.</p>
    <p><strong>Future Work:</strong> Explore integrating Snort and Suricata in a hybrid IDS solution and investigate the use of machine learning for enhanced detection capabilities.</p>
